Features with High Multicollinearity\n","\n","\n","When features are highly correlated, it becomes difficult to isolate the individual effect of each variable on the target variable and the relationship between features and the target will be difficult to interpret. This leads to challenges in understanding which variables are mostly responsible for the outcome. Models with high multicollinearity also lead to high variance which means that the model is highly sensitive to the training data and can produce large changes in predictions with small changes in the dataset, increasing the likelihood of overfitting as the model cannot capture a more general pattern and is instead too tailored for the training data.\n","\n","\n","\n","Note the error message below, \n","\"divide by zero encountered in scalar divide, vif = 1. / (1. - r_squared_i)\"\n","\n","This means that R^2 is equal to 1, so the feature being evaluated is perfectly predicted by other features (perfect multicollinearity).

For example, if a fighter has a 0.2 average for significant strikes, it indicates that 20% of their strikes are significant. However, this average can be very misleading.

A higher depth will lead to a more accurate model, but it can also lead to the tree capturing noise and small changes leading to overfitting the data, and of course, more computing power is needed for deeper trees.

A higher number of samples will help stop the creation of nodes that are too specific, which can lead to overfitting.

Limiting the number of features creates diversity with the trees in the forest which helps improve the generalization and reduces overfitting. High values will result in each tree having access to most of the features, leading to accurate trees but might reduce the generalization and leads to overfitting. Low values results in each tree seeing a small set of features, increasing generalization  but less accurate trees and potential underfitting. Integer values means # of features, while float values mean % of features\n","\n","\n","Random Forests are less affected by multicollinearity as it randomly select a subset of features for each tree split. This random selection reduces the impact of multicollinearity because each tree is not affected by all features simultaneously. However as seen above, many of the features were highly correlated with each other so a lot of the features selected will affect the model performance. In the presence of multicollinearity, feature importance scores might not clearly reflect the true importance of features because correlated features may share importance. Random Forests might assign importance to multiple correlated features rather than isolating the contribution of each."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"id":"057a219e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.393175Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.392829Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.565478Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.564543Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.192379,"end_time":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.568273","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.375894","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV\n","from skopt import BayesSearchCV\n","from skopt.space import Real, Integer\n","\n","\n","# parameter grid for Grid Search and Random Search\n","# parameter_grid = {\n","#     'n_estimators': [50, 100, 150],        \n","#     'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],       \n","#     'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],    \n","#     'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],    \n","#     'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2']  \n","# }\n","\n","\n","# # Grid Search\n","# parameter_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), \n","#                            param_grid=parameter_grid, \n","#                            cv=5,                            \n","#                            verbose=0)                      \n","# # Best Parameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'max_features': 'log2', 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'min_samples_split': 10, 'n_estimators': 150}\n","\n","# # Random Search\n","# parameter_search = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(),\n","#     param_distributions=parameter_grid,\n","#     n_iter=1000,\n","#     cv=5,\n","#     verbose=0\n","# )\n","# # Best Parameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'max_features': 'log2', 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'min_samples_split': 10, 'n_estimators': 150}\n","\n","\n","# # parameter space for Bayesian Optimization\n","# parameter_space = {\n","#     'n_estimators': Integer(10, 200),\n","#     'max_depth': Integer(1, 30),\n","#     'min_samples_split': Integer(2, 20),\n","#     'min_samples_leaf': Integer(1, 20),\n","#     'max_features': ['sqrt', 'log2']\n","# }\n","\n","\n","# # Bayesian Optimization\n","# parameter_search = BayesSearchCV(\n","#     estimator=RandomForestClassifier(),\n","#     search_spaces=parameter_space,\n","#     n_iter=500,  \n","#     cv=5,      \n","#     verbose=0\n","# )\n","# # Best Parameters: {'max_depth': 20, 'max_features': 'log2', 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'min_samples_split': 10, 'n_estimators': 150}\n","\n","\n","# parameter_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","# best_params = grid_search.best_params_\n","# best_rf_model = grid_search.best_estimator_\n","\n","# y_pred = best_rf_model.predict(X_test)\n","\n","# print(f'Best Parameters: {best_params}')\n","# print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}')\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","# more general params?\n","# n_estimators=50,max_depth=10,min_samples_split=20,min_samples_leaf=1,max_features='sqrt', random_state=42)\n","\n","\n","# rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50,max_depth=10,min_samples_split=20,min_samples_leaf=1,max_features='sqrt', random_state=42)\n","# rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","\n","# y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)\n","\n","\n","\n","# print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b44f37d6","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.016403,"end_time":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.602261","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.585858","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## XGBoost\n","- **n_estimators**: [Definition](#section4)\n","- **max_depth**: [Definition](#section4)\n","\n","- **subsample**: Controls the fraction of randomly sampled training ddata that is used for each tree. A high value close to 1 means that most of the training data is used for each tree, which generally leads to less variance and potentially more overfitting. A low value introduces randomness and can help in preventing overfitting by making the model less dependent on any particular subset of the data.  Lower values can improve generalization as each tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, but if the value is too low then model may not have enough data to train each tree effectively, leading to underfitting.\n","- **colsample_bytree**: Controls the fraction of randomly sampled features used for each tree. A high value means that most features are used for each tree which leads to less feature randomness but can lead to overfitting. A smaller value results in smaller and less complex models, which can help prevent overfitting but has risks of underfitting.\n","\n","- **min_child_weight**: Controls the the number of samples required to create a new child node in a decision tree. When making a tree, the nodes only split if it would result in child nodes with the sum of weights being more than the min_child_weight. A larger value means that more instances are required in a node before it can be split which produces simpler trees with fewer splits, this can prevent the tree from capturing important patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. Smaller values means that fewer instances are required to create child nodes, allowing the model to create more splits and leads to complex trees that capture intricate patterns in the training data, but this increase the risk of overfitting.\n","\n","Using the DART booster to help prevent overfitting."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"id":"99aee6be","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.638937Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.63811Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-20T04:18:15.6779Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-20T04:18:15.676619Z"},"papermill":{"duration":3.061127,"end_time":"2024-08-20T04:18:15.680244","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-20T04:18:12.619117","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Accuracy: 0.82\n"]}],"source":["import xgboost as xgb\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from skopt import BayesSearchCV\n","\n","# parameter grid for Grid Search and Random Search\n","# param_grid = {\n","#     'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],         \n","#     'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],\n","#     'max_depth': [3, 6, 9],                    \n","#     'min_child_weight': [1, 3, 5],             \n","#     'subsample': [0.8, 1],                \n","#     'colsample_bytree': [0.8, 1]}\n","\n","# #
